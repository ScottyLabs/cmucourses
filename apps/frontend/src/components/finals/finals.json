At the urban scale, we will examine diverse city planning traditions, including early grid designs, City Beautiful and Garden City movements, the impact of industrialization, and the rise of suburbanization. We will analyze the redevelopment of urban nodes and the tensions between historic preservation and urban renewal. The course will also investigate how zoning laws, racial segregation policies, and economic forces have shaped the cityscape. At the architectural scale, our focus will center on the design and transformation of housing in the American city. We will study a range of dwelling types, including row houses, immigrant tenements,  apartments, public housing projects, and private developments. Throughout the course, we will consider how political decisions, economic systems, and social movements have influenced the design and use of urban spaces.",

This course uses the lens of business and economics to bring some clarity to the way we think about healthcare and its impact on our nation's wellbeing. We describe the major actors and institutions within the US healthcare system, and the key strategic, managerial, and financial issues facing industry executives and public policy-makers. We start with an initial \"big picture\" of the healthcare system and lay out some of the principles by which it operates. We introduce a host of \"players\" and \"policy issues\". The players are the various healthcare sectors (e.g., provider organizations, medical professions, technology suppliers); the policy issues concern the nagging problems of quality improvement, cost control, improving access, and reducing inequity. The course also covers some of the major intermediaries that connect these segments: insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and wholesalers. Finally, we examine the producers of the innovative products in the healthcare industry - pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medtech sectors- on a global basis.",

Yet considering the daunting task Congress faces in legislating for an incredibly diverse nation of 340 million people while its members represent constituencies with starkly differing interests, perhaps it is more surprising that the body functions at all. This class investigates how Congress overcomes the obstacles to action it faces as well as whether the institution has operated less effectively in recent years, and if so, the reasons why. Specifically, we will scrutinize what the legislative process looks like in practice and how the structure of Congress interacts with the electoral, partisan, ideological, and interest-group influences on its members to determine their behavior. To accomplish this objective, we will apply rational choice theory to analyze Congress as social scientists do while also evaluating the limitations of this approach. In addition, we will examine the place Congress occupies in the broader governmental system, exploring its relationships with the presidency, courts, and federal bureaucracy. Throughout the semester, we will assess Congress's performance in terms of effectiveness and representation along with what can be done to improve it.",

Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.    One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.    Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Work is done in two-person teams, and \"team programming\" skills (source control,  modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities.

In a globalized world the standards of cultural exchange have sometimes led to a process of encroachment and the subversion of a native culture.  As one of the most visible of cultural products, however, film clearly demonstrates that this is frequently not the case.  There is a complex interplay between pressures to globalize and the traditional concerns and norms of societies.  An examination of the discourse and rhetoric of filmed texts provides evidence of cultures working to maintain their identity, adapting new modes of expression to their own ends and actively exporting their own cultural ideas through the medium of cinema.  To illustrate this point, we will closely examine the cinematic output of a variety of national film industries, including those of Japan, China and Korea from the mid-1940's to the present day.  At the conclusion of this course students will have a basic knowledge of film output in the selected regions, be aware of the aesthetic traditions, stylistic tendencies and rhetoric of those films, and have an understanding of issues of cultural exchange as reflected in East Asian film.",

This course charts that history through an exploration of the 14th Amendment.  That Amendment (1868) guaranteed citizens \"equal protection\" under the law and put this illusory promise into the U.S. Constitution for the very first time.  So profoundly did it transform the nation that scholars refer to it as the nation's \"Second Founding.\"  Progressive social movements leveraged the 14th Amendment to create the modern rights revolution.  Most modern equality law\u2014guaranteeing our equal treatment and equal protection\u2014rests on this one amendment. The history of the modern Supreme Court has, in many ways, been defined by battles over the 14th Amendment's meaning, which we'll explore in class. Deciding in favor of equality and protection for increasing numbers of Americans (from civil rights, to women's rights, to queer rights), the Court is now signaling its interest in reversing the 14th Amendment jurisprudence it has steadily developed over the past 75 years.

Who decides which voices should be heard, which voices should be ignored, and which version of history is the 'right' one? In this course, we will consider 'alternative' histories of 1789, which is not to say, necessarily, that the officialized and accepted accounts of 1789 are wrong; the question is whether they are complete. When historical accounts and the voices that tell them are marginalized, we may perhaps not see the fullest version possible.  In order to explore other, alternative accounts of France and the Revolution of 1789, we will rely on texts that recount versions of the revolution from different perspectives. Some voices to be investigated, besides a sampling of the most famous ones (Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette, Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Marat, Danton, Robespierre...) are those of Tussaud, Corday, de Gouges, de Sta\u00ebl, Siey\u00e8s, and of the Girondins and the Montagnards in their civil war. We will examine pamphlets, posters, speeches, newspaper articles, satirical cartoons, memoires, art depicting the revolution, and literary works, with the goal of understanding multiple aspects of this seemingly larger than life historical event. Lastly, we will examine a supranatural telling of 1789, as another 'alternative' history. All work will be in French.",

Through this framing, we might view classical statistics problems, like estimating the likelihood that a coin lands on heads as an ML problem: the task is to produce an estimate, and the experience would consist of observations. But ML can also include robotics challenges, where the experience is acquired dynamically as our artificial agent interacts with the real world.

The laws and concepts of classical thermodynamics and probability are briefly reviewed, and then applied to introduce the atomic statistical definitions for temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic equilibrium. Statistical methods for enumerating the microscopic configurations of fluids, magnets, solid crystals, and polymers will be covered and applied to evaluate thermodynamic free energies subject to varying macroscopic constraints. These will be used to relate equilibrium properties and phase behavior to the engineerable molecular details of materials. Applications will include equilibrium phase diagrams (binary and ternary), predominance diagrams, chemical reactions, thermodynamics of surfaces, and electrochemistry.",

We will prepare the background for Socrates and Plato by studying major Presocratic philosophers such as the Milesians, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, and then dive in to a careful study of some of the central works of Plato and Aristotle. A key theme of the class will be the way in which Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle sought to define philosophy in opposition to sophistry, and how the lessons learned from their confrontation with sophistry informed their ethical and metaphysical thought. The final sections will discuss post-Aristotelian movements such as Epicureanism, Skepticism, and Stoicism.",

    "desc": "American Pragmatism represented an energetic attempt to bridge the divergent cultures of science and the humanities. The movement's founder, C.S. Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was developed and popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirce's position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.",

It draws together research from psychology, economics, political science, and management, among other fields.  It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems.  The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making.  Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.  The course emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship between theory and application.",
